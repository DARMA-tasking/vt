The GoogleTest*.cmake files are modified from the original.
The base versions are also included for a diff reference.

GoogleTest 3.18+ cmake features used:

- 'gtest_discover_tests' (modified) to avoid source regex greps.

- DISCOVER_MODE=PRE_TEST, which is used.

Changes:

- Using vt_ prefix to minimize confusion
  eg. 'vt_gtest_discover_tests'.

- Remove support of 'gtest_add_tests', to ensure test discovery is used.

- Remove support of POST_BUILD as a DISCOVER_MODE to ensure it is not used.

- Allow specifying the command to execute the test executable.
