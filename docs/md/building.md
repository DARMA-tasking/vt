\brief Building DARMA/vt with cmake

\vt can be built with `cmake` or built inside a `docker` container. Most of the
external dependencies come bundled with \vt for ease of compiling.

\section how-to-build Building

To build \vt, one must obtain the following dependencies:

\subsection required-deps Required
  - checkpoint, (*vt* ecosystem)
  - MPI         (mpich/openmpi/mvapich/IBM Spectrum MPI/Cray MPICH/etc.)

\subsection automatic-build-deps Automatically build dependencies

Assuming MPI is installed and accessible via CC/CXX, the only other dependency
that is required is checkpoint. The easiest way to get these
built are to clone it inside `vt/lib`:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:DARMA-tasking/vt
$ cd vt/lib
$ git clone git@github.com:DARMA-tasking/checkpoint
```

With these in `vt/lib`, cmake will automatically build them and stitch them into
*vt*'s linking process.

\subsection use-cmake-directly-vars Using cmake directly

One may use `cmake` as normal on *vt*, with checkpoint cloned in
`vt/lib` to compile them all together as explained above. The following are some
custom configuration build options that can be provided to `cmake` to change the
build configuration:

\subsection using-the-build-script Using the Build Script

Instead of running `cmake`, one may invoke the `vt/ci/build_cpp.sh` script which
will run `cmake` for *vt* with environment variables for most configuration
parameters.

With these set, invoke the script with two arguments: the path to the *vt* root
directory and the build path. Here's an example assuming that *vt* is cloned
into `/usr/src/vt` with trace enabled in debug mode.

**Usage for building:**

```bash
$ vt/ci/build_cpp.sh <full-path-to-vt-source> <full-path-to-build-dir>
```

**Example:**

```bash
$ cd /usr/src
$ git clone git@github.com:DARMA-tasking/vt
$ VT_TRACE_ENABLED=1 CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug /usr/src/vt/ci/build_cpp.sh /usr/src/vt /usr/build/vt
```

\subsection docker-build Building with `docker` containerization

The easiest way to build *vt* is by using `docker` with the available containers
that contain the proper compilers, MPI, and all other dependencies. First,
install `docker` on the system. On some systems, `docker-compose` might also
need to be installed.

The `docker` builds are configured through `docker-compose` to use a shared,
cached filesystem mount with the host for `ccache` to enable fast re-builds.

For `docker-compose`, the following variables can be set to configure the
build. One may configure the architecture, compiler type (GNU, Clang, Intel,
Nvidia) and compiler version, Linux distro (ubuntu or alpine), and distro
version.

The default set of the docker configuration options is located in `vt/.env`,
which `docker-compose` will read.

```
# Variables:
#   ARCH={amd64, arm64v8, ...}
#   COMPILER_TYPE={gnu, clang, intel, nvidia}
#   COMPILER={gcc-8, gcc-9, gcc-10,
#             clang-8, clang-9, clang-10,
#             icpc, icpx,
#             nvcc-11, nvcc-11.2}
#   REPO=lifflander1/vt
#   UBUNTU={18.04, 20.04, 22.04}
#   ULIMIT_CORE=0
#
# DARMA/vt Configuration Variables:
#   VT_LB=1                   # Enable load balancing
#   VT_TRACE=0                # Enable tracing
#   VT_MIMALLOC=0             # Enable mimalloc memory allocator
#   VT_DOCS=0                 # Enable doxygen build
#   VT_TRACE_RT=0             # Enable tracing at runtime (for testing)
#   VT_ASAN=0                 # Enable address sanitizer
#   VT_UBSAN=0                # Enable undefined behavior sanitizer
#   VT_WERROR=1               # Treat all warnings as errors
#   VT_EXTENDED_TESTS=1       # Build all the extended testing
#   VT_ZOLTAN=0               # Build with Zoltan enabled
#   VT_UNITY_BUILD=0          # Build with Unity/Jumbo mode enabled
#   VT_FCONTEXT=0             # Force use of fcontext for threading
#   VT_DIAGNOSTICS=1          # Build with diagnostics enabled
#   VT_DIAGNOSTICS_RUNTIME=0  # Enable diagnostics at runtime by default
#   BUILD_TYPE=release        # CMake build type
#   CODE_COVERAGE=0           # Enable generation of code coverage reports
#   VT_DEBUG_VERBOSE          # Enable verbose debug prints at compile-time
#   VT_NO_COLOR_ENABLED=0     # Set --vt_no_color flag to true by default
#   VT_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=0    # Build VT as shared library
```

With these set, one may run the following for a non-interactive build with
ubuntu. Or, to speed up the build process, the base container can be pulled for
many of the common configurations: `docker-compose pull ubuntu-cpp`.

```bash
$ cd vt
$ docker-compose run -e BUILD_TYPE=debug -e VT_TRACE=1 ubuntu-cpp
```

Or, alternatively, run a non-interactive build with alpine:

```bash
$ cd vt
$ docker-compose run -e BUILD_TYPE=debug -e VT_TRACE=1 alpine-cpp
```

For an interactive build with ubuntu, where one can build, debug, and run
`valgrind`, etc:

```bash
$ cd vt
$ docker-compose run -e BUILD_TYPE=debug -e VT_TRACE=1 ubuntu-cpp-interactive
# /vt/ci/build_cpp.sh /vt /build
# /vt/ci/test_cpp.sh /vt /build
# /vt/ci/build_vt_sample.sh /vt /build
```

The same call applies to alpine distro builds if you swap
`ubuntu-cpp-interactive` for `alpine-cpp-interactive`.

For more detailed information on configuring the docker build, read the
documentation in `vt/docker-compose.yml`.

\section test-vt Testing

After *vt* is built successfully, one may invoke the tests several ways. One may
run `make test` or `ninja test` (depending on the generator used) or `ctest`, to
run all the tests. Alternatively, the tests can be run automatically from the CI
script:

```bash
$ vt/ci/test_cpp.sh <full-path-to-vt-source> <full-path-to-build-dir>
```
