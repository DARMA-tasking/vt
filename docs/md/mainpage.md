*Efficient, distributed task-based programming made easy*

Welcome to the DARMA documentation!

The DARMA project is positioned at the forefront of asynchronous many-task (AMT)
research and development (R&D), providing production-quality dynamic runtime
software for scientific HPC applications. DARMA provides powerful capabilities
for dynamically scheduling tasks, incrementally (re-)balancing loads, data
serialization & movement, and programming abstractions that yield performance
portability. The DARMA team partners with key application/domain-specific teams
to drive development, implement requisite functionality, and production-harden
runtime software tailored to Sandiaâ€™s mission-critical applications.

DARMA has two organizations on Github: one for the public facing code and
another for private/internal code, which has not be formally released.

  - DARMA Public Organization: [DARMA-tasking](https://github.com/DARMA-tasking)
  - DARMA Private/Internal Organization: [DARMA-tasking-internal](https://github.com/DARMA-tasking-internal)

The DARMA teams develops an integrated toolkit of codes/repositories that work
together to provide efficient, task-based distributed processing on large
supercomputer architectures. The main public repositories are:
