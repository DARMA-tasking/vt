 * \brief Base context for runnable tasks.
 *
 * \c ctx::Base is used to create contexts that are associated with tasks
 * wrapped with the \c runnable::Runnable class. When messages arrive and
 * trigger a handler or other actions occur, contexts that inherit from \c Base
 * can be used to maintain a particular context when that runnable is passed to
 * the scheduler for later execution. The \c begin() and \c end() methods are
 * called when the task starts and stops. If VT is built with user-level threads
 * (ULTs), \c suspend() and \c resume might be called if the thread that a task
 * is running in suspends the stack mid-execution (typically waiting for a
 * dependency). Thus, any context is expected to save all state in suspend and
 * then return that state back during resume when the ULT is resumed.
