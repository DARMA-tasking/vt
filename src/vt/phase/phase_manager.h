 * \struct PhaseManager
 *
 * \brief General management of phases in an application to delineate collective
 * intervals of time across nodes.
 *
 * Many system components use phases as a natural boundary for performing
 * incremental operations as the runtime makes progress. For instance, traces
 * may be flushed at phase boundaries and the load balancing framework might
 * apply a strategy between phases.
 *
 * The main interface for users is invoking
 * \c vt::thePhase()->nextPhaseCollective() to start the next phase. The system
 * performs a reduction and blocks completion inside this call. Any work
 * that belongs in the preceding phase should be synchronized before this is
 * called. The runtime system or users can register hooks when a phase starts,
 * ends, or after any migrations are complete. Hooks may be collective or
 * rooted; collective hooks are invoked in the order in which they are
 * registered and are always run in a collective epoch.
