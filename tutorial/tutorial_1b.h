 * ramifications) to the functor style, which follows (MsgHandlerB). Either
 * style can be used to define a message handler. The only slight benefit the
 * functor has is uniqueness in type, when enables introspection of the message
 * type. This is realized in the sending side code: the function style requires
 * the message type before the value function template parameter. However, both
 * are *fully type checked* and will not allow the wrong message type to be
