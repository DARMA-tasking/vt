   * This is an example of the collective group creation and broadcast to that

   * group allows all nodes to participate in creating the group by passing a
   * boolean that indicates if they are apart of the group.
   *
   * Unlike the rooted group creation (which requires an initial set at a root
   * node), the collective group is fully distributed: its creation and
   * storage. The set of all nodes included is never stored in a central
   * location. This is managed by efficient distributed algorithms that create a
   * spanning tree based on the filter and rebalance it depending on outcomes.
